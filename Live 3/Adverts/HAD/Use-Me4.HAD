°2I need all kinds of Pack Menus.
I want old ones, new ones, good ones,
bad ones, crazy ones and lame ones.

°3So start looking in your diskboxes 
and put all the menus you have on 
a disk and send that disk to:

°2                  RADAVI / EFFECT
                     P.O.BOX 7143
              3430 JC  Nieuwegein
                          Holland

°1You can also send bootmenus, we will
get them off that boot.

°2I will (ofcourse) send your disk back
with my latest PACK MENUS PACK on it
