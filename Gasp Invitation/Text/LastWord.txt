We  hope  that  you'll enjoy reading all those informations and you're at this
moment packing your's bags to come to our party.  We are now ready to make the
best party ever made in France.  We have working very hard since we spread the
first  informations  (on  22/08/94!  So one year before the party!) and now we
are  really waiting for you...  We wanna just advertise to all foreigners that
we have travelled a lot to prepare the GASP, we visited so many parties so far
away from our home, so now it's your turn, come in France !!!
